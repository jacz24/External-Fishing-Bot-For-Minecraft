<b>NEW IN VERSION 2.25! NOW WORKS ON WINDOWS 10! The bot now works without Sndvol! No longer will you have to manually select locations or have extra windows open. By request I was asked to look into the windows 10 issues. Custom skins, Themes, and win10 would break the program. I'm now just using  AudioSession.EnumerateAll  to gather the sound information. This program now will let you mute minecraft (From volume mixer) & still play music in the background with no issues.</b>

<b>Features:</b>
-   Options for Mending (Unlimited Throws)
-   Auto Catch Detection
-   Hot-bar Utilization
-   Smart Save (Save Rod's Enchantments)
-   Anti-Afk Protection
-   Leave World/Server Option
-   Variable Customization
-   Rod-Lock Protection (If Rod Broke Early Skip)
-   Player Swing Offseter

<b>About:</b> 
<p>This bot will allow you to fish automatically while AFK. With normal fishing rods lasting 64-Durability each, that gives you a maximum of 576 Catches. Enchanted rods with unbreaking will allow you to go much further. Keep in mind the <i>Rod-Lock Protection</i> feature will automatically skip to the next hotbar item if no catch was detected as it assumed rod broke early (Helps with custom throws & Unbreaking RNG). This bot will also record all progress live in the bot-stats box. Have fun getting rich!</p>

<b>How do I use the program?</b>
- Extract the contents of the zip file.  
- Launch the auto-fishing bot (Run as admin).  
- Launch your game if you have not already.  
- Click the _start bot_ button.  
- Go back to your game, unpause, let the bot take over.  
- Enjoy your kittens! ![](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/images/emotions/emo5.png "Smile")

<p>Note: The <i>Sound VU Sensitivity</i> is basically self explanatory but essentially its how loud your game has to get before pulling the rod in. I added a VU Level <i>Capture</i> at the bottom right. This can be used to find how loud your "Fish" is when it bites. Simply press, find highest value, add.</p>

<b>Requirements:</b>
<p>
- In your <i>music & sounds...</i> settings, you will want to turn all sounds off except <i>Master Volume</i> & <i>Friendly Creatures</i>.<br> 
- Bellow are a few key-binds you need to change in your games settings. (If you wish to use these settings)

-   Auto Eject Rod -> Must Bind <i>Drop Selected Item</i> as <i>middle-mouse-button</i> (Push down scroll wheel)
-   Anti-AFK -> Must Bind <i>Sneak</i> as <i>left-mouse-button</i> (Left click button)
